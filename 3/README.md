# Work: Fundamental 2D Array Traversal Operations

## GOAL:

Gain familiarity with 2D array manipulation through implementation of basic traversal functions.

## GUIDELINES:

This skeleton-based task lends itself well to a driver/codriver paradigm: one person shares screen, types, while all dialogue in real time to generate code.

## YOUR CODING MISSION:

Fill in the missing body of each method and use the main() method to test. You are welcome to add additional code to the main() method, but do not delete any existing code.

## PROTIPS:
Design first. Sketch out your plan on paper ("keys to success"), transcribe into comments in your code file.
Get something, however, minimal, to compile and run ASAP. Incrementally grow it until it aligns with your goal.
Never stray far from runnable code.
Grow cohort KB ("knowledge base") on slack:
Have a Q? Ask.
Confident in your skills/knowledge? See how well you can explain it.
DELIVERABLE:
Save in your_work_repo: 3/TwoDimArray.java
Include heading at top of file, as comment. List all collaborators and consultants.
Work: Putting 2D Arrays to Use -- CGOL

## GOAL:

Design and implement an engine to play Conway's Game of Life.

## GUIDELINES:

The Rules of Life:

Survivals:

Every cell with 2 or 3 living neighbours survives for the next generation.
Death:

Each cell with >3 neighbours dies from overpopulation.
Every cell with <2 neighbours dies from isolation.
Birth:

Each dead cell adjacent to exactly 3 living neighbours is a birth cell. It will come alive next generation.
Nota bene: All births and deaths occur simultaneously. Together, they constitute a single generation.

## YOUR CODING MISSION:

Read the entire skeleton file, as a team, for understanding.
Discuss, as a team, how you will approach this. Pick the approach that makes the most sense to all teammates, and implement it.
