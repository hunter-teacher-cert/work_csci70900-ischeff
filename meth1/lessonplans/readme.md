# Task:
- Students are to create two detailed lesson plans, outlines and supporting materials for computer science. The lesson plans and outlines should include a description of the intended student audience and a detailed explanation of how multiple pedagogical techniques can be used in delivering the lesson.

- Each lesson plan should demonstrate different pedogogical techniques, though there may be some overlap.

- For example, if the lesson includes subgoal labeling, the project should include the finished desired code along with the subgoal labels included within.

- The plans can be sequential, or entirely separate.

- The plans must also be aligned to the New York State Standards for Digital Fluency and Computer Science.

- The completed assignment should be such that the portfolio can be given to any computer science teacher and they could deliver the lessons as intended.
