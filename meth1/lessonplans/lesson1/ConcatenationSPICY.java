    //What are some other ways we might be able to use this technique?
    //Your answer here:

    //~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ACTIVITY 1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // Now, create variables to represent today's day, date, month, and year.
    // Print each variable after you assign it to check that it contains what you want!
    // YOUR CODE HERE

    // Now, concatenate the variables to print out today's date in both formats!
    // American Format: Friday, July 30, 2021.
    // YOUR CODE HERE
    // European Format: Friday 30 July, 2021.
    // YOUR CODE HERE

    //~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ACTIVITY 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    //The code above is for a SPECIFIC date. How can we write code that GENERALIZES
    // the relationship between the data types that we concatenated?

    //Write out your plan in pseudocode and/or with a diagram.

    //Be prepared to share out your plan! (We will code this up tomorrow!)
