# Lesson 1:
Concatenation

## Lesson objective:
Students will be able to concatenate different data types.  

### Aim:
How can we concatenate different data types?

### Vocab:
Concatenate, concatenation, String, variable, primitive, data type

### Warm up
time: 5 minutes

*Think-Pair-Share:*
- Have you heard the term concatenation before? If so, where have you heard it? What do you recall it signified?
- If you haven't heard the term before, what do you predict it will mean?

---

### Lesson Content
time: 10 minutes

*Mini-lesson:*

Concatenation = when you use the addition operator to combine different data types, typically strings with other strings, or strings with integers.

Data type = another term for primitives in Java, i.e., ints, Strings, Booleans.

*Think-Pair-Share* What do you predict lines 9 and 10 of Concatenation.java will do?
- Expected answer: They will print out the sentence "The temperature today will be 15 degrees."

*Question:*
- Compile and run the program--did it behave as you expected?

*Follow-up Questions:*
- How did you predict the result?
- What is the "+" operator doing?
- Why do you think this works?
- In what situations do you think this might be useful?

### Lesson Activity
time: 15 minutes

Depending on student ability, each pair might try this more than once:
- decompose the problem
- attempt to follow the instructions
- reflect on how it went

Students should have a graphic organizer / template for the different diagrams (tree, bubble, etc.) BUT they can also use blank paper.

Teacher will assess student understanding by walking among the pairs and observing, offering feedback as necessary.

After 7-8 minutes, pairs will pair up in groups of 4. Each group will:
- have one pair share one of their decompositions with the other
- attempt to carry out the instructions the other group came up with.

*Think-Pair-Share:*
What is easy about decomposition? What is hard? Why?

---

### Closing
time: 10 minutes

*Think-Write-Pair-Share:*
If you had to explain the process of decomposition to a younger sibling, how would you do it? What skills would they need to learn to be able to successfully decompose a more complex problem into a simpler one?

Students will respond individually on notecards to be collected.
