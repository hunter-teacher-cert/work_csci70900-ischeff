# Lesson 1:
Concatenation

## Lesson objective:
Students will be able to concatenate different data types.  

### Aim:
How can we concatenate different data types?

### Vocab:
Concatenate, concatenation, String, variable, primitive, data type

### Warm up
time: 5 minutes

*Think-Pair-Share:*
- Have you heard the term concatenation before? If so, where have you heard it? What do you recall it signified?
- If you haven't heard the term before, what do you predict it will mean?

### Lesson Content
time: 10 minutes

*Mini-lesson:*

Concatenation = when you use the addition operator to combine different data types, typically strings with other strings, or strings with integers.

Data type = another term for primitives in Java, i.e., ints, Strings, Booleans.

*Think-Pair-Share* What do you notice and what do you wonder about lines 9 and 10?
- Expected noticings: there is one variable, the variables and strings are combined, the variable represents temperature, the variable is int type
- Expected wonderings: Why didn't they just write 15 in the print statement?

*Think-Pair-Share* What do you predict lines 9 and 10 will do?
- Expected answer: They will print out the sentence "The temperature today will be 15 degrees."

*Question:*
- Compile and run the program--did it behave as you expected?

*Follow-up Questions:*
- What led you to predict the result?
- What is the "+" operator doing?
- Why do you think this works?

*Quickwrite*
- What are some other ways we might be able to use this technique?

### Lesson Activity #1
time: 15 minutes

- Students will individually complete either the mild, medium or spicy versions of this activity.
- They should open the code file of their choice, then follow the instructions. (Everyone will ultimately write lines that print out today's date in both European and American formats.)

*Think-Pair-Share:*
What was easy about this activity? What was hard? Why?

### Closing
time: 10 minutes

*Think-Write-Pair-Share:*
If you had to explain the process of decomposition to a younger sibling, how would you do it? What skills would they need to learn to be able to successfully decompose a more complex problem into a simpler one?

Students will respond individually on notecards to be collected.
