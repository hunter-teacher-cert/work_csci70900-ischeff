## Lesson objective:
Students will be able to decompose a problem into more manageable sub-problems.

### Aim:
How can we decompose complex problems into simpler problems?

### Vocab:
Decomposition, whiteboarding, tree diagram, concept map, bubble map

### Warm up
time: 5 minutes

*Think-Pair-Share:*
How would you teach a younger sibling to tie their shoes? Be as specific as possible!

*Follow-up questions:*
- Why did you break the process down into steps?
- What makes a step the right size in this situation?
- How did you go about deciding what the steps should be?

### Lesson Content
time: 10 minutes

*Mini-lesson:*

Decomposition = the process of breaking complex problems into smaller problems.

*Question:* why do we do this in real life?
- Expected answer: to make life easier

*Question:* Why do we do this in computer science?
- Expected answers: to make life easier, to make coding easier, to make problems simpler.

One way to *decompose* a problem is visually. This is sometimes called *whiteboarding*

Some whiteboarding techniques are:
- tree maps
- concept maps
- bubble maps
- literal drawings

Warm call a student picked during the do now to demo their drawing on the board.

*Questions:*
- Why did you draw it like that?
- How did you decide to break it down?
- What are some other ways he/she/they could have drawn this?

Demo another drawing as necessary.

### Lesson Activity
time: 15 minutes

Students will break into pairs. Then, pairs will review a list of common problems, such as:
- how to open a door
- how to make a sandwich
- how to get dressed
- how to brush your teeth
- *harder option:* come up with your own problem!
(*Note: the above are just examples; if I were to make student-facing materials, there would be between 8 and 10 problems to choose from.*)

Depending on student ability, each pair might try this more than once:
- decompose the problem
- attempt to follow the instructions
- reflect (in writing) on how it went

Students should have a graphic organizer / template for the different diagrams (tree, bubble, etc.) BUT they can also use blank paper.

Teacher will assess student understanding by walking among the pairs and observing, offering feedback as necessary.

After 7-8 minutes, pairs will pair up in groups of 4. Each group will:
- have one pair share their decomposition with the other
- attempt to carry out the instructions the other group came up with.

*Think-Pair-Share:*
What is easy about decomposition? What is hard? Why?

### Closing
time: 10 minutes

*Think-Write-Pair-Share:*
If you had to explain the process of decomposition to a younger sibling, how would you do it? What skills would they need to learn to be able to successfully decompose a more complex problem into a simpler one?
