## Lesson objective:
Students will be able to decompose a problem into more manageable sub-problems.

### Aim:
How can we decompose complex problems into simpler problems?

### Vocab:
Decomposition, whiteboarding, tree diagram, concept map, bubble map

### Warm up
time: 5-10 minutes

*Think-Pair-Share:*
How would you teach a younger sibling to tie their shoes? Be as specific as possible!

*Follow-up questions:*
- Why did you break the process down into steps?
- What makes a step the right size in this situation?
- How did you go about deciding what the steps should be?

### Lesson Content
time: 10 minutes

*Mini-lesson:*

Decomposition = the process of breaking complex problems into smaller problems.

*Question:* why do we do this in real life?
- Expected answer: to make life easier

*Question:* Why do we do this in computer science?
- Expected answers: to make life easier, to make coding easier, to make problems simpler.

One way to *decompose* a problem is visually. This is sometimes called *whiteboarding*

Some whiteboarding techniques are:
- tree maps
- concept maps
- bubble maps
- literal drawings

Warm call a student picked during the do now to demo their drawing on the board.

Demo another drawing as necessary.
