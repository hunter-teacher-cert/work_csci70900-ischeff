## Lesson objective:
Students will be able to decompose a problem into more manageable sub-problems.

### Aim:
How can we decompose complex problems into simpler problems?

### Vocab:
Decomposition, whiteboarding, tree diagram, concept map, bubble map

### Warm up
time: 5-10 minutes

#### Think-Pair-Share:
How would you teach a younger sibling to tie their shoes? Be as specific as possible!

#### Follow-up questions:
Why did you break the process down into steps?
What makes a step the right size in this situation?
How did you go about deciding what the steps should be?

### Lesson Content
time: 10 minutes

*Mini-lesson*:

*Decomposition* = the process of breaking complex problems into smaller problems.

  *Question*: why do we do this in real life?
  Expected answer: to make life easier

  *Question*: Why do we do this in computer science?
  Expected answers: to make life easier, to make coding easier, to make problems simpler.

One way to *decompose* a problem is visually--*tree diagrams, bubble maps, concept map*

This is sometimes called *whiteboarding*

Demo whiteboarding with example from do-now (ask for a student volunteer)
