# Prompt:
Day 1 of Netlogo, how do you want to introduce it? (Might include some guided programming, i.e., look at Model X and do something with it. -- Why did you pick X model?) Some other questions: do you want folks to explore openly? Do you want to guide them? Focus on your own metacognition: why would you make the decisions you would make as a teacher in introducing the language? tl;dr - > make a text file (can be a narrative where you describe how you would intro Netlogo and why you would do it that way

### Note:
My response takes the form of the questions I would pose, organized in a narrative flow from the start to end of this hypothetical class period.

## Response:
**Start:**
- Raise your hand if you speak more than one language.
- What do you recall about learning your second language? What was easy? What was hard?
- Today, we'll be learning (or starting to learn) a new programming language, Netlogo.
- What do you predict we'll need to do? What do you predict we *should* do?
---
**First Activity:**
- *Students will be given some code in Netlogo and an equivalent snippet of code in a language they know. (This could be printed or just on the board)*
- What do you see? What do you think? What do you wonder?
- What do you predict this code will do?
- *Students will then be directed to log into Netlogo; each group will have a different model to look at. The models and groupings will depend on a lot of things, including student ability and grade level (I would aim for models that relate to content in their science classes, which might mean population models or disease spread or predator-prey cycles)*
- You will now each (in your groups) look at a model using Netlogo. Your goal is not to figure out precisely how the model works, although you *should* play around with it. Your goal, instead, is to determine at least **one** rule of the language that is Netlogo. For instance, you might determine something about how Netlogo declares variables, or creates functions, or stores data. In 10 minutes, you will do a gallery walk to check out the rules that the other groups have figured out!
- *After 10 min of work time (5 more if necessary), the groups will share their work with each other.*
- What did you notice, looking at the work of the other groups? What rules have we figured out so far?
- *Some more specific follow up questions based on the specific rules deduced by the groups*
- What seems easy about Netlogo? What seems hard?
- Before you leave, please jot down 3 things you learned about Netlogo today, 2 things you found interesting and one question you still have. *(Exit Ticket)*
