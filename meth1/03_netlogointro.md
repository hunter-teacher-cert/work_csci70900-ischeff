# Prompt:
Day 1 of Netlogo, how do you want to introduce it? (Might include some guided programming, i.e., look at Model X and do something with it. -- Why did you pick X model?) Some other questions: do you want folks to explore openly? Do you want to guide them? Focus on your own metacognition: why would you make the decisions you would make as a teacher in introducing the language? tl;dr - > make a text file (can be a narrative where you describe how you would intro Netlogo and why you would do it that way

## Response:
**Start:**
- Raise your hand if you speak more than one language.
- What do you recall about learning your second language? What was easy? What was hard?
- Today, we'll be learning (or starting to learn) a new programming language, Netlogo.
- What do you predict we'll need to do? What do you predict we *should* do?
---
**Group Activity:**
- *Students will be given some code in Netlogo and an equivalent snippet of code in a language they know. (This could be printed or just on the board)*
- What do you see? What do you think? What do you wonder?
- What do you predict this code will do?
- *Students will then be directed to log into Netlogo; each group will have a different model to look at. The models and groupings will depend on a lot of things, including student ability and grade level (I would aim for models that relate to content in their science classes, which might mean population models or disease spread or predator-prey cycles)*
- You will now each (in your groups) look at a model using Netlogo. Your goal is not to figure out precisely how the model works, although you *should* play around with it. Your goal, instead, is to determine at least **one** rule of the language that is Netlogo. For instance, you might determine something about how Netlogo declares variables, or creates functions, or stores data. In 15 minutes, you will do a gallery walk to check out the rules that the other groups have figured out!
- *After 15 min of work time, the groups will share their work with each other.*
- What did you notice, looking at the work of the other groups? What rules have we figured out so far?
- *Some more specific follow up questions based on the specific rules deduced by the groups*
---
**Wrap-Up**
- What seems easy about Netlogo? What seems hard?
- Before you leave, please jot down 3 things you learned about Netlogo today, 2 things you found interesting and one question you still have. *(Exit Ticket)*
--**Reflection**
Many of my students are multi-lingual; the most common languages they speak other than English are Spanish, French, and a range of African languages, like Twi. Consequently, I think it would make sense to start introducing Netlogo by having them reflect on their experience learning a new language; I assume they would discuss paying close attention to similarities and differences with their native tongue. Since that's the goal of the activity--to pay close attention to the code of the models, in order to intuit some of the rules of NetLogo--I would want students to be primed with this thought pattern from their prior experience. The reason I didn't specify a model to use for this lesson is that I would want to use a model (or models, rather) that draw upon students pre-existing knowledge in another domain: their science class. Some potential models might be the one where the birds are eating bugs, or one that models the spread of a disease; since they would be talking about that topic in science, it would likely prime them to learn from a model of that concept in CS. This would also help get over the hurdle of what the model is about, in order to bring the focus on the code--the ultimate goal is to read over the model, in order to deduce some of the rules of Netlogo. (This would be further scaffolded by the brief pre-activity mini-lesson, outlined above, in which I would show the class two code snippets, one in a language they know, and one in Netlogo.) Since this would be just the first day of using Netlogo (and not the last), the goal would be modest: start learning the rules of the language, and *not* by me giving them the rules. I'd rather they start deducing the rules, so that they learn them more deeply, the same way we are learning how linked lists work by actually building a linked list class first in Java. In my head, a reasonable goal would be to have students able to write some minimal program in Netlogo at the end of the first week of using the language; this first day would be the first step in that direction!
