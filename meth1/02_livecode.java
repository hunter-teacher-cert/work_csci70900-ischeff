//How should I start?
public class Hello { //start writing a print Hello world statement withOUT declaring the class; see if anyone notices; if not, circle back when it doesn't compile
  public static void main(String[] args){//again, just start with a print statement withOUT any of this at first if no one brings it up.
    System.out.println("Hello world!");//What would happen if I remove the quotes? NOTE: don't add semicolon at first. Maybe also don't add quotes.
  }
  System.out.println("Hello world, again!"); //now, ask for input on creating another print statement--can be different from this--but put it OUTSIDE the main method; see if anyone notices.
} //Don't include and/or misplace the brackets and see if anyone notices.

//as errors come up--and there will be a LOT of compilation errors, make sure to read through each one with the class and get their thoguhts on what is going on/what should change.

/*
A brief list of expected errors:
- class not declared (when you just start with print statement)
- no main method (when you just start with print statement)
- print error (when string isn't formatted correctly)
- lacking semicolon
- error that class and filename aren't the same 
*/
