/**
Your driver file should contain code to (in suggested development order)
1) instantiate a newly-created Time object (aka "instance of class Time") with default value(s)
2) instantiate a newly-created Time object with specified value(s)
3) assign a Time var the value null
4) assign a Time var the value of an existing Time var
5) print all of the above (See multiple ways to do this? Try all -- and document in comments!)
6) test for equality of each of the Time instances above. Print results.
7) add two Time objects and print results
8) add two Time objects and save the result in another Time object
