Instructions: Work: Mancala

GOAL:

Collect as many stones as possible in your mancala.

RULES:

you can only move stones on your side
a move consists of collecting all stones in a pit and dropping them 1 by 1 into each consecutive pit in a counterclockwise direction
if last stone dropped is into your mancala, you go again
if last stone dropped is into an empty pit on your side, you capture the stones in the opposite pit (store in mancala)
GAMEBOARD:

M p p p p p p
  p p p p p p M
key: p: pit m: mancala

YOUR CODING MISSION:

With your new team, write a program to facilitate a mancala game in the terminal.

"AI"-vs-human or human-vs-human (you choose)
prompt user for which pit they wish to empty
display relevant info after each turn:
state of the board
location of last stone dropped
which player goes next
facilitate play until one entity wins, and announce winner
PROTIPS:
Design first. Sketch out your plan on paper ("keys to success"), transcribe into comments in your code file.
You will be prompted to share your algo (or algo-in-progress) to the chat after teams have had time to work up their approaches. At this point, all teams will be encouraged to review others' approaches and offer feedback and/or take inspiration.
Get something, however, minimal, to compile and run ASAP. Incrementally grow it until it aligns with your goal.
New to java and/or arrays? Since the primary goal here is to grow facility with 1D arrays, simply getting the stones transfer algorithm implemented for a single player's side of the board (not bothering with emptying pits on the other side) would be a good thing to aim for...
Never stray far from runnable code.

Grow cohort KB ("knowledge base") on slack:
Have a Q? Ask.
Confident in your skills/knowledge? See how well you can explain it.
DELIVERABLE:
Save in your_work_repo: 2/Mancala.java
Include heading at top of file, as comment. List all collaborators and consultants.
