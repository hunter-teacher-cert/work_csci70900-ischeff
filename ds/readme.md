# Course Description

This course will provide aspiring and practicing teachers with a
deeper knowledge of computers science. Students will study data
representation in computer systems and data abstraction
techniques. Topics covered include static and dynamic storage methods,
lists, stacks, queues, trees, recursion and analysis of algorithms and
their applications relevant in a classroom setting.


## Schedule
	- July 9 - July 30, Monday - Friday 9:00 - 11:30


## Grading

	- 80% : Projects/programming assignments (listed by topic)
    - 20% : Participation


## By the end of this course, students will be able to:

  - understand each data structure covered in this course.
  - implement the covered data structures to solve a variety of real
    world problems.
  - design appropriate algorithms, data structures, and solutions to
    solve a variety of problems in a variety of domains
  - design learning experiences for a diverse population of learners
     in the domains of data structures and algorithms and applied data
    structures and algorithms.
