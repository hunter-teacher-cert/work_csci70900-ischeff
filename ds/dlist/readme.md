# Doubly-Linked List

- Implement a doubly linked list.
- A doubly linked list is similar to a linked list but has both next and previous references.
- Your doubly linked list should have private instance variables for prev and next (and anything else you need). If you'd like you can also have one for current (the current node).
- Implement all methods that we implemented for the singly linked list.
