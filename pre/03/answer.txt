Think Java 4.11

Exercise 1

1) What is the output of the following program? Be precise about
where there are spaces and where there are newlines. (Hint: Start
by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.)

As far as I can tell, the program should output the following:

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

Since the Java Virtual Machine will first execute the method "main"
and the method "main" instructs us to first write "No, I " that is
where we begin. Then the code invokes the zoop method, which itself
invokes baffle, prints "You wugga " and then invokes baffle again. The
baffle method, in turn, outputs "wug" and then invokes ping, which itself
outputs a period and moves us to a new line by using println.

Thus, the flow of execution is as follows:
+ output "No, I "
+ invoke zoop
+ invoke baffle
+ output "wug"
+ invoke ping
+ output "." and newline
+ output "You wugga "
+ invoke baffle
+ output "wug"
+ invoke ping
+ output "." and newline
+ output "I "
+ invoke baffle
+ output "wug"
+ invoke ping
+ output "." and newline


2) Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first
time ping is invoked.

main [No, I]
zoop [     ]
baffle [wug]
ping [.\n]

3) What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method?

As far as I can tell, this would trap the program in an endless loop,
in which you are constantly outputting wug, adding a period, skipping
a line, then repeating this process.

This is because the baffle method also invokes the method ping, so
when zoop is invoked in the main method, which invokes the baffle method
which prints "wug" and then invokes the ping method, if we invoked baffle
at the end of ping then we would ping-pong back to the baffle method,
which would then print "wug" again and invoke the ping method, adding a
period and a newline, then print "wug" and invoke ping again and so on.

So the program would do this:

No, I wug.
wug.
wug.
wug.

And so on.
