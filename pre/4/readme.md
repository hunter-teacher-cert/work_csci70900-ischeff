This section covers conditionals. Java if statements look pretty much the same as those in Javascript

## Conditionals

// Example A - simple if
if (boolean)
  statement;

// Example B - if with compound statement
if (boolean){
    statement1;
    statement2;
    ...;
    statementn;
}

// Example C - if with else
if (boolean){
    statements;
} else {
    statements;
}

// Example D - if with else chain
if (boolean1) {
    statements;
} else if (boolean2) {
    statements;
} else {
    statements;
}
In Examples B through D, if you don’t have multiple statements in each section you don’t need that sections curly braces but it’s generally considered good form to use them. Also, Example D can have any number of else if sections.

A Python if is similar but different due to its use of indentation instead of brackets and the explicit elif as opposed to the Java else if.
